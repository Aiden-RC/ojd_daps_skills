This demo app is using Nesta's [Skills Extractor Library](https://github.com/nestauk/ojd_daps_skills)
to extract skills for a given job advert and map them onto a skills taxonomy of
your choice. Multiple organisations, from private corporations to government bodies, have developed skills taxonomies to organise labour market skills in a structured way.
By mapping extracted skills to a pre-defined taxonomy, you are able to take advantage of the additional benefits of a taxonomy, including its structure and skill definitions.
This library was made possible via funding from the [Economic Statistics Centre of Excellence](https://esco.ec.europa.eu/en/classification/skill_main).
We currently support three taxonomies out-of-the-box:
1. The [European Commission's Skills Taxonomy](https://esco.ec.europa.eu/en/classification/skill_main), a multilingual classification of European Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations;
2. [Lightcast's Open Skills Taxonomy](https://skills.lightcast.io/) and;
3. A [Toy Taxonomy](https://github.com/nestauk/ojd_daps_skills/blob/dev/ojd_daps_skills/config/extract_skills_toy.yaml) that is helpful for testing.
